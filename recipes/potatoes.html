        <h4>Description</h4>

        <p>
          If you've ever had bang bang chicken or bang bang shrimp, you know the
          flavor profile belongs on almost all your favorite foods—including
          potatoes. Here, we take bang bang sauce—a combination of mayo, sweet
          Thai chili sauce, sriracha, and rice vinegar—and drizzle it over
          shatteringly crispy oven-roasted potatoes. A cornstarch slurry coats
          the potatoes for an extra-crunchy crust on each spud. The combination
          of flavors and textures in this dish is not to be missed. Here's how
          to make it.

            <li>1 1/2 lb. baby gold potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

          <h4>Steps</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredient..</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
            <li>
              Toss together potatoes and olive oil on a large rimmed baking
              sheet until fully coated. Whisk together cornstarch, salt, onion
              powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a small bowl until combined.
              Sprinkle evenly over potatoes; toss to coat, arranging potatoes in
              an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until deep golden brown and crispy on
              all sides, stirring every 10 minutes, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove
              from oven and let rest on baking sheet for 5 minutes before
              transferring to a serving dish.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile prepare the sauce; whisk together mayonnaise,
              buttermilk, Sriracha, sweet Thai chili sauce, and rice vinegar in
              a small bowl until fully combined. Drizzle sauce over potatoes;
              garnish with sliced scallions.
